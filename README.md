# tddchallange

Fully tested web component modal window. Each commit is a part of the way. Tests fail, code written to make them pass. The whole process was done without opening the browser to see the results until the end.

# Installation

`npm i` or `yarn`

# Usage

After installation of node modules is done, just run: 

`npm run test` - to run the tests

`npm run serve` - to run a dev server

`npm run build` - to build

**Enojy!!**
